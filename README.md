# rust-book-cli-example

This repository is the chapter 12 of the rust book code follow along. Not really exact, but will adhere to the concepts being taught in the book. I would probably use Clap v3.0 today instead. In fact, I'll take a stab after this one and link it in this readme.

Let's do this! ðŸ”¥
